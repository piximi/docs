# How to develop for Piximi

## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there

This section will explain our workflow and vision, to get you kickstarted as fast as possible! Both technical and non-technical contributions are welcome and encouraged! 

#### Technical Contributions

In addition to general-purpose programming tasks, thereâ€™re numerous tasks for anyone with expertise or an interest in computer graphics, computer vision, image processing, or machine learning. 

#### Non-Technical Contributions

Thereâ€™re also a number of areas thatâ€™d benefit from non-technical contributors too, including writing or improving documentation or translations, packaging example classifiers, and even providing user feedback \(especially around problems in fields where current contributors lack familiarity\).
